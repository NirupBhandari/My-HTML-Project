                <h3>Nanobots will plug our brains straight into the cloud</h3>
                Tech of the future: nanobots. He believes, that by the 2050, nanobots will plug our brains straight
                into the cloud, it will give us full immersion virtual reality from within the nervous system. Just
                like we do know with our smartphones, we will be able to do it with our brains, we’ll be able to
                expand our neocortex in the cloud. And forget about memory problems, evidence problems, etc.
                </p>

                <h3>Reincarnation through AI</h3>
                Sounds scary, I know! And probably most of the religious people will be very against it, however,
                Kurzweil says that we will be able to “bring back” our relatives through artificial intelligence.
                He says that by 2050, we’ll be able to send nanobots into people’s brains to extract memories of
                loved ones. Augment that with a DNA sampling of the deceased, and it will be possible to create a
                convincing virtual version of somebody who’s passed on. If you are interested in it, there is a
                movie about it: the discovery.

                <h3>AI will become a positive net job motivator</h3>
                Many people worry about AI in our lives as they think that at the end robots will replace people and
                we won’t have jobs for is.

                <h3>IoT technology will change product designs</h3>
                According to Forbes, by 2050, IoT technology will be in 95% of electronics for new product designs.
                And by 2050 it is expected to have everything connected to the cloud and to the internet.

                <h3>Space tourism: a week in orbit</h3>
                According to Business Insider, Space tourism could be feasible in 2050, but likely only for the very
                wealthy.
                Rocket companies like Jeff Bezo’s Blue Origin and Elon Musk’s SpaceX will push the envelope with
                space travel enough that tourism will be feasible in the year 2050.
                For example, “someone who could afford to pay 100 million quid could spend a week in orbit… but it
                would only be for rich people in 2050.” he said. “It’s not going to be something that’s cheap
                anytime soon.”

                <h3>Cars will make driving safer</h3>
                Despite the crashes involving self-driving cars that have hit the headlines these years, this area
                of AI could dramatically reduce deaths and injuries on our roads. According to a report by Stanford
                University, not only will self-driving cars reduce traffic related deaths and injuries, but they
                could bring about changes in our lifestyles as well. We will have more time for ourselves.
                Also, the increased comfort and decreased cognitive load with self-driving cars and shared
                transportation may affect where people choose to live.

                <h3>Charge your iphone with the power of a plant</h3>
                Did you know that you can charge your iphone with the power of a plant? Forests can become the
                energy stations of the future. Now it is becoming possible, for example, Bioo is a clean-tech
                company capable of generating electricity from plant’s photosynthesis. Here you can watch a video to
                know more about it.

                <h3>Ocean Thermal Energy can take us to 100% renewable-energy</h3>
                Ocean thermal energy, is a largely untapped resource, and one of the world’s largest renewable
                energy sources. For example, right now Bluerise is working on creating an energy breakthrough by
                generating utility scale electricity through Ocean thermal energy conversion. It will be able to
                outcompete fossil fuel based generation and other renewables that require storage and grid
                balancing. It will play a crucial role in the future energy mix being one of the very few constant
                energy sources, available day and night, year-round.

                <h3>EU will face a shortage of IT workers</h3>
                There is a huge demand for developers in Europe, yet most IT education is solely available in
                English. With 24 official languages spoken in Europe alone, it’s no surprise that non-native English
                speakers prefer to learn in their own language. However you can start seeing many coding academies,
                schools and universities focused only on training junior developers for specific companies’ demand,
                being it a language, a practice, etc. Even though this problem won’t be solved right now, with these
                new IT universities and academies, we can fix the situation by 2050.

                <h3>Drone solution for discovering untouched places</h3>
                Deep in underground mines, some zones are inaccessible. But company like Inkonova started to work on
                builds drones that fly, drive and climb and use laser technology to scan zones, and create a 3D map
                of them. With this advancing aerial robotics technology we will be able to push human reach to any
                space untouched by man-made infrastructure.

                <h3>Half of current jobs in the world are unlikely to exist in 2050</h3>
                The world is changing faster than we think and the way we learn things and what we learn should be
                changed. Employers should create an engaging learning culture at work by empowering their staff to
                take ownership of their professional development. Read more about it here.
