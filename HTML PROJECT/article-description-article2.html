                    The most famous pilgrimages of Hindus, Kedarnath is elevated at 3,568 metres in the district of
                    Rudraprayag in Uttarakhand. Located amidst the majestic Himalayas in the Garhwal region, Kedarnath
                    is the most important dham among the Char Dham in Uttarakhand. Every year, from May to November,
                    lakhs of devotees visit this religious place to seek blessings from the powerful descent of Lord
                    Shiva, who is also known as Kedarnath. People from all around the country, as well as travellers
                    from different countries, visit the temple by trekking a 16-kilometres-long stretch starting from
                    Gaurikund or with the help of other facilities like Palki, Dandi, Ponies and Mules. The temple is
                    open to visitors from May to November and remains closed in winter as the roads to the temple are
                    closed due to heavy snowfall.

                <h3>Change in Kedarnath Temple Darshan Timings</h3>

                <p>
                    Owing to the decreasing number of pilgrims due to heavy rains, the temple authority changes the
                    timings of Kedarnath darshan. Now the devotees will be able to have darshan from 5 AM to 9 PM, which
                    was previously from 4 AM to 11 PM.
                </p>

                <h3>Phone and Electronic Gadgets Restriction</h3>

                <p>
                    Kedarnath Temple has decided to strengthen the precautionary measurements to protect the temple and
                    its facets. The authority has banned mobile phones and other electronic gadgets inside the temple.
                    They also started thinking about making locker rooms near the temple, so that devotees can submit
                    their stuff before entering the temple.
                </p>


                <h3>Entrance to Garbha Griha</h3>

                <p>
                    One of the another latest updates from Kedarnath Temple Dham is that devotees can now enter the
                    Garbha Griha of the temple, where the deity resides. Owing to a large number of visitors, it wasnâ€™t
                    previously allowed, but now, as the number of devotees has been reduced due to the heavy rainfall in
                    Uttarakhand, the authority decides to allow them into the Garbha Griha.
                </p>
