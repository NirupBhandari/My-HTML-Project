                    We know that staying active is one of the best ways to keep our bodies healthy. But did you know it
                    can also improve your overall well-being and quality of life?
                </p>

                <p>
                    Here are just a few of the ways physical activity can help you feel better, look better and live
                    better. Because, why not?
                </p>

                <h3>It’s a natural mood lifter.</h3>
                <p>
                    Regular physical activity can relieve stress, anxiety, depression and anger. You know that "feel
                    good sensation" you get after doing something physical? Think of it as a happy pill with no side
                    effects! Most people notice they feel better over time as physical activity becomes a regular part
                    of their lives.
                </p>
                <h3>It keeps you physically fit and able.</h3>
                <p>
                    Without regular activity, your body slowly loses its strength, stamina and ability to function
                    properly. It’s like the old saying: you don’t stop moving from growing old, you grow old from
                    stopping moving. Exercise increases muscle strength, which in turn increases your ability to do
                    other physical activities.
                </p>


                <h3>It helps keep the doctor away.</h3>
                <p>
                    Stand up when you eat your apple a day! Too much sitting and other sedentary activities can increase
                    your risk of heart disease and stroke. One study showed that adults who watch more than 4 hours of
                    television a day had an 80% higher risk of death from cardiovascular disease.
                </p>

                <h3>Being more active can help you:</h3>
                <p>
                    your blood pressure
                    boost your levels of good cholesterol
                    improve blood flow (circulation)
                    keep your weight under control
                    prevent bone loss that can lead to osteoporosis
                    All of this can add up to fewer medical expenses, interventions and medications later in life!
                </p>

                <h3>It can help you live longer.</h3>
                <p>It’s true, 70 is the new 60… but only if you’re healthy. People who are physically active and at a
                    healthy weight live about seven years longer than those who are not active and are obese. And the
                    important part is that those extra years are generally healthier years! Staying active helps delay
                    or prevent chronic illnesses and diseases associated with aging. So active adults maintain their
                    quality of life and independence longer as they age.
                </p>

                <h3>Here are some other benefits you may get with regular physical activity:</h3>
                <p>Helps you quit smoking and stay tobacco-free.
                    Boosts your energy level so you can get more done.
                    Helps you manage stress and tension.
                    Promotes a positive attitude and outlook.
                    Helps you fall asleep faster and sleep more soundly.
                    Improves your self-image and self-confidence.
                    Helps you spend more time outdoors.
                    The American Heart Association recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic
                    activity each week. You can knock that out in just 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week. And every minute
                    of moderate to vigorous activity counts toward your goal.
                </p>

                So, this is easy! Just move more, with more intensity, and sit less. You don’t have to make big life
                changes to see the benefits. Just start building more activity into your day, one step at a time.
                </p>
