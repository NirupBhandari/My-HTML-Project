                    To get started investing, pick a strategy based on the amount you'll invest, the timelines for your
                    investment goals, and the amount of risk that makes sense for you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rent, utility bills, debt payments and groceries might seem like all you can afford when you're just
                    starting out, much less during inflationary times when your paycheck buys less bread, gas or home
                    than it used to. But once you've wrangled budgeting for those monthly expenses (and set aside at
                    least a little cash in an emergency fund), it's time to start investing. The tricky part is figuring
                    out what to invest in — and how much.
                </p>

                <p>As a newbie to the world of investing, you'll have a lot of questions, not the least of which is:
                    How much money do I need, how do I get started and what are the best investment strategies for
                    beginners? Our guide will answer those questions and more.
                </p>

                <h3>Here's what you should know to start investing.</h3>

                <h3>Start investing as early as possible</h3>

                <p>Investing when you’re young is one of the best ways to see solid returns on your money. That's
                    thanks to compound earnings, which means your investment returns start earning their own return.
                    Compounding allows your account balance to snowball over time.
                </p>

                <p>At the same time, people often wonder if it's possible to get started with a little money. In short:
                    Yes.
                </p>

                <h3>Decide how much to invest</h3>
                <p>
                    How much you should invest depends on your financial situation, investment goal and when you need to
                    reach it.
                </p>

                <h3>Open an investment account</h3>
                <p>If you’re one of the many investing for retirement without access to an employer-sponsored
                    retirement account like a 401(k), you can invest for retirement in an individual retirement account
                    (IRA), like a traditional or Roth IRA.
                </p>

                <p>If you're investing for another goal, you likely want to avoid retirement accounts — which are
                    designed to be used for retirement, and have restrictions about when and how you can take your money
                    back out.
                </p>

                <h3>Pick an investment strategy</h3>
                <p>
                    Your investment strategy depends on your saving goals, how much money you need to reach them and
                    your time horizon.
                </p>

                <h3>Understand your investment options</h3>

                <h3>Stocks</h3>
                A stock is a share of ownership in a single company. Stocks are also known as equities.

                <h3>Bonds</h3>
                <p>
                    A bond is essentially a loan to a company or government entity, which agrees to pay you back in a
                    certain number of years. In the meantime, you get interest.
                </p>

                <h3>Mutual funds</h3>
                <p>
                    A mutual fund is a mix of investments packaged together. Mutual funds allow investors to skip the
                    work of picking individual stocks and bonds, and instead purchase a diverse collection in one
                    transaction. The inherent diversification of mutual funds makes them generally less risky than
                    individual stocks.
                </p>

                <h3>Exchange-traded funds</h3>
                <p>
                    Like a mutual fund, an ETF holds many individual investments bundled together. The difference is
                    that ETFs trade throughout the day like a stock, and are purchased for a share price.
